Palladion Brand Guide

Tagline: The Safeguard of Trust

Palladion is a fintech/legaltech platform built on trust, transparency, and security. The name comes from the mythological Palladion, a sacred safeguard — symbolizing our mission to protect client assets with uncompromising integrity and modern technology.

Our identity should always communicate:

Security – trusted protection of assets.

Transparency – clarity for clients and firms.

Innovation – modern tools for legal + financial industries.
